<p> <a> Reflection:</a> This project began by exploring how a webpage can function as an interactive tool. The goal was to ensure that users have an enjoyable experience by engaging creatively with the interface. For my project, The Makeover, I drew inspiration from early 2000s web-based games that allowed users to customize their avatars by changing their clothing and makeup. In my version, however, the avatar represents the user themselves. By clicking on each icon, users can move their heads in alignment with the icon's position on the page. Additionally, users can stack multiple icons to create an entirely new appearance.
  The coding process was challenging, particularly in implementing the video camera feature so that users could see themselves in real time. Another difficulty was managing the different elementsâ€”ensuring they could be layered correctly or removed from the screen when the corresponding icon was clicked again.
  Overall, in the future, I aim to refine the video display method and introduce additional elements to provide users with a more dynamic and varied experience.
