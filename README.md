My name is Kirsten Visbach and I am a first-semester design student studying Visual Communication at HBK Braunschweig. This website serves as a platform to apply the knowledge I have acquired throughout the semester. I have gained valuable insights during my studies and am committed to further developing my skills for future projects.
